    A Remote grant is a grant that connects to a fakts server,

    This is a highly configurable grant, that can be used to
    dynaimcially *discover* the endpoint, *demand* a token
    to access a token, and then *claim* the configuration
    from the endpoint.

    This grant is highly configurable, and can be used to
    implement any kind of remote grant.

    You can use a specific builder to build a remote grant
    that fits your needs.
